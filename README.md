# DEMOS Emotion Recognition Repository

This repository is designed for testing our trained models on the dataset presented in the article:
“DEMOS: A Dataset for Emotion Recognition from Skeletal Movement” ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-022-01887-4)).

The repository enables researchers to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models for emotion recognition based on skeletal body movements. By leveraging the DEMOS dataset, we aim to support advancements in multimodal emotion recognition and encourage further research in this domain.
